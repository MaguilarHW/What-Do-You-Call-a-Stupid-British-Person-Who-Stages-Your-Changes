What Do You Call a Stupid British Person Who Stages Your Changes?

READ ME:

Git:
Two options for creating the repository, if no parameters given, name will be ".aGit", otherwise name will be as specified when made.
File.separator is used for paths in order to ensure code works on multiple operating systems, same with naming and hiding folder.

GitTester:
Method to verify if all required repo files were initialized (.repoExists)
Method that iterates through folder and removes all files, including anything potentially added later in project process (.cleanup)
Multiple tests to see if different cases produce errors. Details documented in tester.
