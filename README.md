What Do You Call a Stupid British Person Who Stages Your Changes?

READ ME:

Git:
Two options for creating the repository, if no path given, or if invalid path, git will be created in current folder.
File.separator is used for paths in order to ensure code works on multiple operating systems
Hash function explains what it's doing in the method (I took this from online I cannot explain it to you sorry)

GitTester:
Method to verify if all required repo files were initialized (.repoExists)
Method that iterates through folder and removes all files, including anything potentially added later in project process (.cleanup)
Multiple tests to see if different cases produce errors. Details documented in tester.
